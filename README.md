# ReflectanceFusion-Diffusion-based-text-to-SVBRDF-Generation
Result of ReflectanceFusion
The ReflectanceFusion result comprises ï½ž700 randomly composed texts, each of which has been generated four times. Within each file, the first image is a rendered picture, the second is the normal map, the third is the albedo, the fourth is the roughness, and the fifth is the specular map.

ðŸŒŸ Key Features

Text-to-Material Generation: Create detailed SVBRDF maps from natural language descriptions
High-Quality Output: Generates 10-channel maps including normals, diffuse albedo, specular reflectance, and roughness
Physically-Based Rendering: Produces PBR-ready materials compatible with modern rendering engines
Dual-Phase Architecture: Combines Stable Diffusion 2.0 with custom ReflectanceUNet for superior quality
Editable & Relightable: Unlike static images, outputs can be freely edited and relit in any environment
Flexible Control: Optional physical parameters (roughness, specularity) for enhanced customization
Complex Semantics: Generate materials with intricate patterns like "dragon carved wood" or "bike embroidered fabric"


Result Structure
Each generated material includes:

Rendered image - Preview under lighting
Normal map - Surface geometry details
Albedo map - Base color information
Roughness map - Surface smoothness
Specular map - Reflective properties
